# VisuallyHidden

Sometimes we need to give extra context to those who don't see the screen.
This component wraps its children in a `span` and visually hides it.

In some cases, using `VisuallyHidden` can be better than using `aria-label`.
For example:

* There can be variations in how screen readers announce `aria-label`.
* Some users use automatic systems to translate pages (e.g., Google Translate), and these systems don't always translate `aria-label`.

export const Template = (args) => (
  <Button icon="settings" circle>
    <VisuallyHidden {...args} />
  </Button>
)

<Canvas>
  <Story of={VisuallyHiddenStories.Default} />
</Canvas>
