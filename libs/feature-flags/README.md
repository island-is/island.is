# Feature Flags

This library is a low-level wrapper for whatever feature flag service **Island.is** is using.

For high-level libraries, check out the following:

- [`@island.is/react/feature-flags`](../react/feature-flags/README.md)
- `@island.is/nest/feature-flags` (...coming soon)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Feature flagging is a way to soft launch a "beta ready" feature to a specific
group of users.

Feature flagging is not a way to hide a feature from the users that is still a
work in progress.
{% endhint %}
