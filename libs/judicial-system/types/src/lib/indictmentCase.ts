/*
  This function takes an array of verdict info tuples:
  - The first element of the tuple is a boolean indicating whether the defendant can appeal the verdict.
  - The second element of the tuple is a Date object indicating when the defendant viewed the verdict. Undefined if the defendant has not viewed the verdict.
  The function returns a tuple of two booleans:
  - The first boolean indicates whether all defendants who need to see the verdict have seen it.
  - The second boolean indicates whether all defendant appeal deadlines have expired.
