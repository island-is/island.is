# Utils

This folder is for all the utility functions and constants.

The organization of this folder is up to the developer. Try to aim for a happy medium between small focused files and too many files that bloat the folder. The aim is that a developer can enter this folder and understand what the utils are for and have a nice overview of the utils.

Files should follow camelCase naming.

Constants should follow SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE naming.

## Example

|-- utils/
|-- |-- utils.ts (can be split up into multiple files)
|-- |-- constants.ts
