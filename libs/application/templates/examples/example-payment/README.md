# Application Templates Example Payment

This is a demo application intended to act as a reference for developers working on
applications in the application system to refer to and use as testing grounds when working
with payments in their respective applications.

There's a few moving parts when handling payments, and we do have a guide on how to implement
payments in applications over here: [Application payment guide](/handbook/misc/application-payment-guide.md)

So this serves as the missing link so people have an example to look at and try out and compare.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test application-templates-example-payment` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
