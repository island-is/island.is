### States

#### Prerequisites

This state is a temporary state that all new applications will be created in. It has a short lifespan and is unlisted.

The purpose of this state is to be a guard into the actual application. There the applicant reads general information on the processing and data collection for applications at TR. There is an external data step which fetches data from Þjóðskrá and TR. If the applicant is not a pensioner (old age, disability or rehabilitation), does not have a registered domicile in Iceland or they are above the income criteria they cannot advance to the next step and make an application.

#### Draft

Valid applicant will be able to advance to this state where they can start the actual application and fill in all the relevant data.

#### Tryggingastofnun submitted

When applicant has sent in the application to TR the application is in this state. Here the application can be edited.

#### Tryggingastofnun in review

For application to be in this state, TR need to make a state change when they start to review the application. Here the application can not be edited.

#### Additional document required

If TR needs additional documents to finish processing the application they can make a state change so the applicant can add their missing documents.

#### Approved

Application has been approved by TR.

#### Rejected

#### Dismissed
