# Delegation API

## About

This is an internal api for delegation management for the Delegation System in My Pages.

## Getting started

To run the API locally, you can either connect to the AWS dev db or run a database container locally.
For further instructions on how to start the database please see [Getting started in IDS API](../ids-api/README.md#getting-started)

When the database is running then start the service:

```bash
yarn start services-auth-delegation-api
```
