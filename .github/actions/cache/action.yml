    # to enable S3 bucket caching in CI while avoiding issues in local Act runs.
    # When running locally, RunsOn would attempt to access a bucket with an empty
    # name, causing the workflow to skip any caching. When this step is skipped
    # (env not set), RunsOn falls back to actions/cache, which Act implements a local
    # version of.
