# lint-and-parse.sh
# This script runs Nx lint for specified projects, captures the raw output,
# strips ANSI escape codes, and then processes it to generate a file with
# each linted file and its lint count.

# Usage: ./lint-and-parse.sh <AFFECTED_PROJECTS> <FILE_PATH>
# <AFFECTED_PROJECTS>: Comma-separated list of Nx projects to lint.
# <FILE_PATH>: Filename of the processed lints

# - If a line looks like a file path, it stores it and resets the counter.
# - If a line looks like a lint warning/error (contains :LINE:COL warning/error), it increments the counter.
# - When a new file path is found or at the end of the file, it prints the previous file's total.
