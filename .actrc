# Config for running GitHub actions locally with [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act)

--platform=arc-runners=821090935708.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/actions-runner:latest

## Mounts and user/env config in container
# Mount common dependencies as a volume; yarn needs it cache folder to exist, and won't try to create them – mounting here to ensure the folder exists
--container-options -v dependencies:/home/runner/dependencies -v dependencies-yarn:/home/runner/dependencies/.yarn/cache

# Homedir wasn't writeable on our EC2 runners, but ARC-runners are OK
# --env=HOME=/tmp/github/home

## Events, secrets, and config
--eventpath=.event.json

## Remote actions
# To run fully local/offline (only fetches actions when missing, on first run),
