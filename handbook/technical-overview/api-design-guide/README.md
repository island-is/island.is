# API Design Guide

_Draft 1 - Published 2020-08-31_

This is the home of the API Design Guide published by Stafrænt Ísland as a best practice guide for API development. It should help synchronize the work between developers and make working together easier. The guide covers the relevant design principles and patterns to use so the consumer experience is enjoyable and consistent throughout APIs.

This guide is under constant review and updates will be made over time as new design patterns and styles are adopted.

All feedback is welcomed and encouraged to help make the guide better so please feel free to create pull requests.
