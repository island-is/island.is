# CMS

- Status: accepted
- Deciders: devs, management
- Date: 2020-05-25

## Context and Problem Statement

island.is will be maintaining and publishing content from many different government agencies and institutions. Their technical skill may vary a great deal, the content skill may also be lacking, therefore it is paramount for the system to be user friendly and intuitive.

Agencies and institutions should have enough autonomy with regards to editing content they are responsible for, to minimise the manual labour required by the island.is editors.

Which CMS system would best suit the needs of island.is?

## Decision Drivers

- Content needs to be editable by non technical users
- Content needs to be accessible across multiple domains and platforms
- Setup should be simple for developers new to the project
- The system should manage flexible content structures to limit systems impact on design
- The system should be user friendly and easy to use for a non technical person
- The system needs to offer a suitable workflow option to ease content management once multiple agencies start to contribute

## Considered Options

- [Gather content](https://gathercontent.com/)
- [Prismic](https://prismic.io/)
- [Contentful](https://contentful.com/)
- [Content stack](https://www.contentstack.com/)
- [Whitehall](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/apps/whitehall.html)
- [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), other hosted solutions,

## Decision Outcome

Devs narrowed the choice down to two options Contentful and Contentstack.

Both systems meet the required featureset.

A decision from management was made to use Contentful.
Contentful is deemed to have a larger presence in the Icelandic dev community.
Contentful is also believed to have a stronger funding base.
Contentful is already implemented in some of our projects.

- Good, because you have endless control over these types of systems
- Good, because there's a huge ecosystem of pre-built stuff
- Bad, because the huge ecosystem has a huge quality control problem
- Bad, because you will need specialised knowledge of these systems to maintain them and get out of them what you want.
- Bad, because you will have to host them yourself, take care of backups and maintenance and there are regular serious security breaches with these systems.

### [Whitehall](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/apps/whitehall.html)

- Bad, because it's built around Gov UK and we would have to fork the project to use it safely
- Bad, a lot of upfront work would be required to adapt the system to our stack
- Bad, because it does not fulfill the project's requirements
